				<p>James Schwartz is a first-year student in the Multimedia Production Diploma program at Lethbridge College. James is passionate about learning all he can that the program has to offer, so he can use those skills to create ideas in projects in the future. </p>
				<p>James loves to play video games in his spare time. He specifically likes to play RPGs, and action games. Video games have always inspired him and motivated him to create his own stories or games that are locked in his head waiting to be created.</p> 
				<p>He was on the honour roll in middle school. James is most proud of surviving high school with a learning difference, and then pushing himself to go to college. 
				James loves to spend time with his twin brother whether it is playing games or getting into deep conversations that only they can understand. He also will go and help his grandfather with outside work that he needs done. James doesnâ€™t listen to music much, but when he does, he will listen to music from his favourite games. He hasn't been outside of Canada much, however, he would really like to travel to Japan, or South Korea and explore the amazing culture.</p>
				<p>James is inspired by his grandfather, and all the wisdom that he shares with him. He has also been inspired by Youtubers that he watches. They motivate him to be himself and to push and work hard to get things he desires in life no matter how difficult it is.
